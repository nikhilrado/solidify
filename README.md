# Solidify (Frontend)
Solidify is a website I created for my AP CSA final project that lets users visualize data in three dimensions. Inspired by Github Skyline, users can upload data in a CSV file and view it in a three-dimensional form using webGL and three.js. Users can also purchase their 3d model by placing an order through the Shapeways API. Shapeways offers high-quality 3d products in many materials. Payments are processed through Stripe and all backend API requests are handled by serverless functions run on AWS Lambda.

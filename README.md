# Solidify
Solidify is a website I created for my AP CSA project that lets users visualize data in three dimensions. Inspired by Github Skyline the website allows you to upload data in a csv file and view it in a three dimensional form using webGL and three.js. The website also allows users to purchase their 3d model by placing and order through the Shapeways API. Shapeways offers high quality 3d products in many materials. Paments are processed through stripe and all backend requests are handeled by serverless api functions run on AWS Lambda.
